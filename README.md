# DigitationÂ V3

> **PCB Digitization & Testâ€‘Automation Toolkit**

*(Working title â€“ change as you like)*

DigitationÂ V3 is an internal tool that lets engineers analyse a board image, place and manage pads, crossâ€‘check pads against BOM / ALF data, and export standardized **`.nod`** files for ATE systems.  
It also provides helpers for MDIO / SPI communication scripts, thermalâ€‘simulation models for laser soldering, and a PyQt5 UI that integrates these features.

## Quick install (dev mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/digitation_v3.git
cd digitation_v3
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
python main.py
```

## Features

* ðŸ“¸ **Pad digitisation GUI** â€“ place pads, anchors, component footprints on highâ€‘res board images  
* ðŸ“Š **BOM / ALF verifier** â€“ highlight mismatches between schematic and physical layout  
* ðŸ›  **Quick placer & ghost overlay** â€“ rapid placement with row/column logic and visual feedback  
* ðŸ”Œ **Protocol helpers** â€“ SPI / MDIO scripting utilities and packet logger
* ðŸ§° **Extensible plugin architecture** â€“ add new component libraries or exporters easily

## Creating Projects

Choose **Create Project** from the menu and select either:

* **Manual** â€“ pick images and fill in settings yourself.
* **Automatic** â€“ select a VIVA `.mdb` file and the tool loads images and coordinates for you (an "Uploading data" dialog will appear).
